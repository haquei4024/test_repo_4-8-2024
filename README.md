# A New Heading
# This is a line after the heading
# This is a  line after that
# I am now writing things 
# Written in the stars
I am the bone of my sword
Steel is my body
Glass is my heart
I have created over a thousand blades
Unaware of loss
Nor aware of gain
I have no regrets. This is the only path
My body is made of infinite swords
